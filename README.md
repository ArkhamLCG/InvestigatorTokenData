# Arkham Horror LCG Investigator Token Images

A comprehensive collection of investigator token images for Arkham Horror: The Card Game (AHLCG).

## Overview

This repository contains high-quality token images for investigators in Arkham Horror LCG, organized by their ArkhamDB/Arkham Cards investigator codes. These images are perfect for use in digital tools, apps, or any project that needs investigator token representations.

## Usage

Images are organized using the following naming convention:

```
/images/{investigator_code}.jpg
```

Where `{investigator_code}` corresponds to the investigator's code in ArkhamDB or Arkham Cards.

### Examples

- `/images/01002.jpg` - Daisy Walker  
- `/images/02001.jpg` - Skids O'Toole
- `/images/03001.jpg` - Agnes Baker
